## V2 Migration

As of August 15th 2025, we've deprecated the legacy V1 endpoints in favor of the new Etherscan API V2, our latest multichain update.

To reiterate, all methods including balances and source code remain accessible (and better if you're querying multiple chains) once you use the new V2 format.

A legacy V1 endpoint that needs to be migrated looks like these:

```text
https://api.etherscan.io/api
https://api.basescan.org/api
https://api.polygonscan.com/api
https://api.bscscan.com/api
https://api.apescan.io/api
```

You also know if you get a deprecation error message like this:

```json
{
  "status": "0",
  "message": "NOTOK",
  "result": "You are using a deprecated V1 endpoint, switch to Etherscan API V2."
}
```

A word about tooling that uses the APIs, such as Hardhat, Foundry, and Remix have all migrated. If you're seeing this error, make sure to use an Etherscan API Key.

## 1. Create an Etherscan account

[**Sign up**](https://etherscan.io/register) if you don't have an account or if you were using other explorers like BaseScan, BscScan, or Polygonscan.

## 2. Create an Etherscan API Key

Under your Etherscan [**API dashboard**](https://etherscan.io/apidashboard), create a new key.

## 3. Using your existing calls

All V1 endpoints are backwards compatible, so if you had:

```text
https://api.etherscan.io/api?&action=balance&apikey=YourEtherscanApiKeyToken
```

You only need to add `/v2` and a `chainid`:

```text
https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid=1&action=balance&apikey=YourEtherscanApiKeyToken
```

## 4. Using your existing calls from other explorers

All V1 endpoints from other explorers such as Basescan, BscScan, and Polygonscan are backwards compatible, so if you had:

```text
https://api.polygonscan.com/api?&action=balance&apikey=YourPolygoncsanApiKeyToken
```

You only need to use an Etherscan `/v2` path, include a `chainid`, and use your Etherscan API Key:

```text
https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid=1&action=balance&apikey=YourEtherscanApiKeyToken
```
